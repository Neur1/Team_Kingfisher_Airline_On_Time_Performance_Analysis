## Objective of the Project
1. **Understanding Flight Delay Patterns**  
   - To model and analyze airline on-time performance.  
   - To explore the factors contributing to delays, such as weather, time of day, and airline operations.

2. **Analyzing the Worst-Performing Routes**  
   - To identify which routes experience the most delays.  
   - To determine how external factors like congestion affect flight timings.

3. **Improving Airline Performance Metrics**  
   - Using insights to propose strategies for optimizing flight schedules.  
   - Helping airlines improve their on-time performance and customer satisfaction.

## Execution Steps (How to run the project)
1. **Set Up the Environment**:  
   - Install Python and the necessary libraries (see requirements below).

2. **Download the Project Files**:  
   - Clone or download the repository to your local system:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd Airline_On_Time_Performance_Analysis
     ```

3. **Install Libraries**:  
   - Run the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
     ```

4. **Run the Analysis**:  
   - Open the `src/` folder in a Jupyter Notebook or Python editor.  
   - Execute the analysis by running the notebook or script.

5. **View Results**:  
   - The outputs will be saved in the `output/` folder.  
   - Visualizations will be available in the `visuals/` folder.

## Summary of Results
The results of the analysis are as follows:

### Key Metrics
1. **Average Delay per Route**:  
   Identified the top routes with the highest average delays.  
2. **Airline Performance**:  
   Found airlines with the best and worst on-time performance.  
3. **Seasonal Trends**:  
   Analyzed delays during peak travel seasons.  
4. **Factors Influencing Delays**:  
   Weather, time of day, and operational inefficiencies were significant contributors.

### Observations
- Certain routes experienced disproportionately high delays due to congestion at hub airports.  
- Airlines with better resource management showed lower delay frequencies.  
- Morning flights were less likely to experience delays compared to evening flights.

### Visualizations
- Line graphs and bar charts showing delay trends by airline, route, and time of day.  
- Heatmaps highlighting the most affected routes.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Handling Missing Data**:  
   - The dataset contained missing and inconsistent values that required preprocessing.  
2. **Large Dataset**:  
   - Processing a large dataset caused memory and performance issues, requiring optimization techniques.  
3. **Visualizing Complex Data**:  
   - Summarizing insights from multiple dimensions (route, time, airline) into clear visualizations was challenging.

## Future Scope
- **Incorporating Machine Learning**:  
   - Predict delays using historical data and external factors.  
- **Real-Time Data Analysis**:  
   - Building a dashboard for live tracking of flight delays.  
- **Expanding the Dataset**:  
   - Include international flights and regional airline performance for a broader analysis.
